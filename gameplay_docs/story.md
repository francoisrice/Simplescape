# Story
## Game Variants
### Fully contained game
Like Spore. Start at the dawn of cavemen and grow to multi-realm Asgardian-esque empire

... Ideas outlined in Phone (Possible ending: All-Father - become Odin, emperor of the 9 realms, even though there are more than 9 realms, there are just 9 major ones)

### Ever evolving sandbox
World with technologies mirroring our own, but can cycle to different "time-periods". Allow connected models, for machine learning and machine intelligence, for robotic simulations, for micro/personal simulations, and for macro/societal simulations

## Characters and individuals on a personal level
- Can choose to have all characters gain experience for all skills at the same rate, only gaining an edge by gaining experience from another source that grants it quicker, or can choose to give playable characters and individual creatures a certain skill or skills that inherent increase faster than those of another character.
- The later approach is more realistic, and could be done well if the natural genius of a character had additional effects on their personality or other facets of their life. There's nothing wrong with an all-powerful superman, but there has to be some rarity to power. 
  - Maybe you can allocate points to a character, but only a certain number and game created characters can go beyond this allocation, through random number generators, or a character is super good at everything because they were bred in a hightly expensive, and labor intensive lab to be that way and can also act in anyway they want because they were deliberately programmed to be that way by a just as intensive process. OR maybe a character is a born super-genius at everything just because the dice fell that way, but because of that, they can only be arrogant or have a limited scope of actions until adversity for growth is given

- Maybe a really good way to do this would be to partially limit points that can be allocated, and give the option for random allocations, but also keep track of a measure of adversity (increased when XP is worked for, but not when its awarded through natural ability). This adversity score then ties into some measure of sentience, or self-reflectiveness that a character has.
- When things come easy to you, they never really leave an imprint on you. When we difficulty in doing something, the activity becomes a part of our identity at least in some sense. When everything is done easily it doesn't shape us at all. We either have the child-like idea that every can come freely (I can have my cake and eat it too) or we gain a lasting bored with our environment or frustration with others around us that are not as capable. Patience, discipline, and ability to endure are learned skills as well as personaluty traits, but they cannot be naturally be learned by an individual who has never met a task that they could not accomplish in one solid stint.
