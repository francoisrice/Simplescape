## Combat Mechanics

### Melee
A melee attack can be made with a Light, Medium, or Heavy weapon. A Light weapon is one that must hit vital areas to be effective. A Medium weapon can crush, slash, or stab a target and has enough weight to cause damage without hitting vital areas. An Heavy weapon mostly crushes a target due to its tremendous weight and ability to generate striking force, and can cause damage to any part of the body and may even break through guards.

A melee attack can also be made when unarmed, giving Unarmed XP, in place of Light, Medium, or Heavy XP. Unarmed attacks deal 1 point of damage. Glove weapoons can also be used as an Unarmed attack with increased damage. 

While these three types of weapons will give experience in their respective categories, each weapon can also be used Aggressively, Defensively or Controlled. When attacking aggressively, 2 Light, Medium, or Heavy XP is gained for every attack. When attacking controlled, 1 XP Light, Medium, or Heavy XP is gained and 1 Stalwart or Mobile XP is gained for every attack. A controlled attack that gives Mobile XP is an "Agile Attack". A controlled attack that gives Stalwart XP is a "Steady Attack". When fighting defensively, 2 Stalwart or Mobile XP is gained for every attack, but no Light, Medium, or Heavy XP is gained, and no attack is made. Fighting defensively to gain Stalwart XP is a "Block Action". Fighting defensively to gain Mobile XP is a "Dodge Action". Attacking aggressively also gives +10% to the attack, while a "Dodge" or "Block" action gives +10% against the attacks made against the defender next turn. 

A creature's hit percentage is determined by their experience with the weapon they are attacking with versus the sum of the defending creatures Stalwart and Mobile experience. If the difference between the defender's sum and the attacker's experience is less than 100 XP, and the attacker's experience is greater, then the hit percentage is the difference between the attacker's experience and the defender's sum. If the attacker's experience is greater than the defender's sum by more than 100 XP, then the attack is guaranteed to hit. Additional attacks made against that target, have a hit chance percentage effectively 100XP less. This continues for each attack until the difference is less than 100XP. If the defender's sum is greater than the attacker's experience by more than 100XP, the attack is uneffective and the effective defender's sum against additional attacks from the attacker is decreased by 100XP. If the defender's sum and the attacker's experience are ever equal, then the attack has a 50% chance to hit. 

(Damage should either be randomly selected from a range dependant on the weapon, or be a selected from the weapons range as a function of the hit. If there was a 50% chance of hitting and a random number of 90 was generated, the weapon would do 80% of max damage.)

(If health increases experience, but damage done doesn't, then higher level fights will take forever. There could be melee upgrades to increase damage, but then there will be some melee builds that deal low damage)

#### Armor
There are 5 different pieces of armor: Helmet, Chest, Legs, Gloves, Boots. 

Armor gives damage reduction from when attacks hit....I think

### Magic
A creature can also perform a magic attack without a power crystal. The creatures target will gain 5% hit chance or take 5% penalty to their next attack, or action. Each magic attack of this type increases, 1 Life Augmentation XP or 1 Projection XP, respectively.   

A ranged magic attack or defense can be made with a power crystal. When defending a target, the target's armor increases by 1 and gives Solidification XP. A magic attack is calculated as a melee attack using the attacker's Projection XP against the defender's sum. A ranged magic attack or defense, with a power crystal, can also be performed aggressively, or controlled, gain 2 XP when done aggressively, or 1 XP for the respective category of Magic and 1 XP to Stalwart or Mobile XP. Aggressive ranged magic attacks also give 10% increase to the attacker's hit chance.

(No healing yet)

Spells can only be cast with a power crystal.

### Ranged
A ranged attack gives XP to the branch of ranged weapon use (Bow & Arrow, Thrown, ...), and can also be performed aggressively or controlled, giving 10% to the hit chance. The attack is made against the defender's sum. 

A ranged attack can be made beyond a weapons range with a 5% penalty to the attack for every square beyond the attacks range
